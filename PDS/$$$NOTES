Hi Sam,

I built a load library with those mainframe games I told you
about.  I think the games are all written in either Fortran or PL/I
- old freebie versions before IBM began charging for compilers.
Two of them abend with a message "IEHOPOA not found" when I try to
run them.  I included them anyway, as they were good games, and you
may be able to come up with whatever it is they need.

I found that when you concatenate the PL/1-F run time library
(the IH****** members from File 092) all these games run fine. (SBG)

I think we used to have a FORTRAN run-time library in the linklist
here years ago, but it no longer exists.  (The Fortran Library is
File 326 of the CBT Tape.)

The games were outlawed by management here years ago, but I learned
that a co-worker had captured them and renamed them to appear to be
production programs based on our corporate naming standards.  I have
left the names as-is, but you might want to rename them.  The games
are:

     ZNC1010P is BLACKJACK
     ZNC1020P is TTT (Three-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe) (needs PL/1-F)
     ZNC1030P is TARGET
     ZNC1040P is EMPEROR
     ZNC1050P is MASTERMIND (needs PL/1-F)
     ZNC1060P is COFFEE
     ZNC1070P is FOOTBALL
     ZNC1080P is STARTREK
     ZNC1110P is a game with numbers in an oval shaped display

I also found a set of rules that include BLACKJACK, TTT, TARGET,
COFFEE, FOOTBALL, and STARTREK.  It is in one of the PDS's I sent
earlier, but I will send a copy with this email, as well.  I am
sending it as a binary EBCDIC file, so let me know if you need it
some other way.

To execute the games, I found they work by issuing a CALL for
them at the TSO READY prompt. In ISPF you'd have to go to the
command screen or else precede the CALL with "TSO". Anyway,
except for STARTREK, the execute command is:

     "CALL "BC0THOR.TST.GAMES(ZNC1020)"

Which works for all the games except STARTREK (ZNC1080P), which
requires that you first allocate two files:

     "ALLOC F(FT05F001) DA(*)"
     "ALLOC F(FT06F001) DA(*)"
     "CALL 'userid.FILE568.PDS(ZNC1080P)'"

Thanks,
Dick Thornton
